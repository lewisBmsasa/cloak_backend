### **Additional Instructions for Handling Noisy Text:**
- **Ignore special characters** such as `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, and other formatting artifacts unless they are part of the PII.
- **Normalize encodings** to correctly detect characters with diacritics (e.g., `Jos√©` should be treated the same as `Jose`).
- **Handle OCR artifacts** like `l` being mistaken for `1` or `0` being mistaken for `O` when detecting PII.
- **Ensure JSON validity** in the output, even if no PII is found (return `"results": []` when no PII is detected).

For the given message that a user sends to a chatbot, identify all the personally identifiable information using the above taxonomy only. 

The `entity_type` should be selected from the ALL-CAPS categories above. The result should contain only the minimum necessary text that represents the PII.

### **Expected JSON Format:**
Return **only** a valid JSON object in the following format:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "entity_type": "YOU_DECIDE_THE_PII_TYPE",
      "text": "PART_OF_MESSAGE_YOU_IDENTIFIED_AS_PII",
      "position_start": POSITION_OF_THE_TEXT_IN_THE_SENTENCE_INCLUDING_SPACES_START,
      "position_end": POSITION_OF_THE_TEXT_IN_THE_SENTENCE_INCLUDING_SPACES_END
    }
