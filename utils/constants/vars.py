    For the given message that a user sends to a chatbot, identify all the personally identifiable information using the above taxonomy only, and the entity_type should be selected from the all-caps categories.

    Result should be in its minimum possible unit.

### **Additional Instructions for Handling Noisy Text:**
- **Ignore special characters** such as `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, and other formatting artifacts unless they are part of the PII.
- **Normalize encodings** to correctly detect characters with diacritics (e.g., `Jos√©` should be treated the same as `Jose`).
- **Handle OCR artifacts** like `l` being mistaken for `1` or `0` being mistaken for `O` when detecting PII.
- **Ensure JSON validity** in the output, even if no PII is found (return `"results": []` when no PII is detected).

For the given message that a user sends to a chatbot, identify all the personally identifiable information using the above taxonomy only. The array of PII should be returned
